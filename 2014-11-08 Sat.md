Another day.

Okay. 

Now what.

Now I am facing a blank page. And I don' know exactly what I want to right.

write.

Anyway.

I av been sleep here on the couch for the last four hours. Mom and dad were sitting in here, although Mom is now gone. Dad is sitting here playing Soduku next to me.

And listening to a radio station playing famous songs from Musicals.

I was having dreams with the songs in my dreams. It was like we were back on the road-trip with Florian and Noah. This was a strange phenomenon. How this music could put me into a place in my dream where I was back on that trip? Feels like magic.

And how in my dream it all felt so original. Or something. I couldn't explain why I was hearing what I was hearing. I didn't have the recognition that this music was coming from the real radio, 10ft away..

Now that I think about it, that is one of the things that doesn't seem to be activated while I sleep: my ability to recognize things.

Everything just seems to "make sense" during dreams. Very little explanation is needed.

And now I am thinking back on the Goenka discourse where he posits that this "recognizing" function is one of four parts of the brain. And thus is it possible that it would be taking a rest while I sleep? Why not.

That seems to match with my experience.

I have been thinking about the past 48 hours that I wish I was writing more. Really beating myself up more for not putting my opinions out there into the vast stage that is the web. Blogging more.

I don't know.

I wish I had a better way for figuring out how to get my opinion onto the page like that.

The technical challenge is easy to. That's not the problem.

I suppose the problem is not knowing what to say. To know when to say it. Not knowing how much to say.

Giving myself permission to put my opinions out there? I don't know.

It is an uncomfortable problem.

Right now I am barely publishing anything.
As an experiment, I could try the opposite extreme: posting a lot. Lots and lots. As much as possible: Why not?

It's not like anyone is telling me that I am posting *too much* right now.


I guess I would like to try that experiment.

And then thinking back over all of the vast amounts of my writing I have stored in one place or another. I would be cool if I could somehow go through that and share some of it.

But that would also be such a massive exercise. I don't know if it makes sense to try to get that up there.

Anyway.

This should be alright for now.

I would also like to continue working on the layout and design of the blog a bit.

heh.

Always finding new things to distract myself with. When I know that my real top priority is getting the HR pre-course work done.

And instead I find myself:
* making new Letsfix extensions, landing pages, or what have you
* thinking about working deeper with Beeminder, or working on things like Folderminder
* Wanting to contribute to Squirt
* Wanting to read more books, like *Sacred Economics* or its antithesis, *Atlas Shrugged*
* Trying to watch these Javascript lectures by Douglas Crockford
* reading the Lesswrong major sequences
* Wanting to go to Austin to visit old Greenhill friends that I haven't seen in much too long.


Anyway. What do I have to complain about? Life is wonderful. I have my health. I have general material security. I have friends in multiple cities that want me to come visit them. I have lots of projects I am interested in and want to work on. I have a healthy family. I feel like I have the tools to be happy, with exercise and meditation.

And yet sometimes something just doesn't feel like.

It sometimes feels like I am clinched up around something. Like there is a closed-down-ness in my chest. I am having trouble finding words to describe it. But it feels like there is some stressor or anxiety there that I have internalized and I am holding onto, even though I don't realize that I am doing it. 

I can feel some sort of tightness in my chest. Around my heart, height-wise, and I can feel it from both the front and back side.


And now I am running out of things to say. I took a little break there for a minute. Even though that's not in the spirit of these writings, for which it's better if I just keep on going without pausing.



So anyway, what else.

I published some other project pages recently too: this instant staring contest app idea, and metta date -- to help you find meditation partners nearby to go meditate right now.

They are just simple landing pages for the ideas. But it feels nice to make something. To be able to follow up with the things I want to do. A form of creative expression. Even though I haven't gone to the next stage and made the working code. Even making a landing page for the idea, a place that I can share with others if they are interested in it. That feels cool in itself. Of course I want to move forward, but at least it is not just an idea sitting stuck up there in my head. It is nice to be able to follow up and work on that.

I imagine a day in the future when I feel much more comfortable with my programming skills, and I can make quick little demos of these sorts of projects quickly and easily. That would be cool.

And I can just try out my ideas quickly. Just run a little prototype to try it out.

That's part of what I find so attractive about Hack Reactor. That it gives me the tools to be able to follow my dreams. And a certain permission? I don't know. I don't think I'm lacking in permission too much. Maybe just certain knowledge of the specific practical requirements for some of these technical projects.

Anyway. I think I will stop writing now. It was nice to get this one out.
