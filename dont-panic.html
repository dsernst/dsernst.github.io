      <p>As with all things in life
      (and especially technical tasks),
      the most important part is that you <strong>believe in yourself</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>Act with self-confidence knowing that:</p>
      <ul>
  	    <li>Nothing you do will actually harm your computer.</li>
  	    <li>No mistake you make is unrecoverable.</li>
  	    <li>You are a child of God - that makes <em>you</em> a <em>god</em> (in embryo).</li>
  	    <li>Gods are more powerful than even computers (believe it or leave it!)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Breathe. Guess. Do. Fail. Guess again. Succeed. (Repeat as needed).</p>
      
      <p><strong>Failure is</strong> an acceptable and <strong>desirable</strong> part of the learning process.</p>
      
      <p>So don't give up just because it's hard.
      You can do it! You're smart.
      Just take guesses, believe in yourself, and give it time.
      You'll get there!</p>
