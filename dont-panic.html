    <p>(Feel free to click that button as many times as you need)</p>
    
    <p>As with all things in life
    (and especially technical tasks),
    the most important part is that you <strong>believe in yourself</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Act with self-confidence knowing that:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>Nothing you do will actually harm your computer.</li>
	    <li>No mistake you make is unrecoverable.</li>
	    <li>You are a child of God - that makes <em>you</em> a <em>god</em> (in embryo).</li>
	    <li>Gods are more powerful than even computers (believe it or leave it!)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Breathe. Guess. Do. Fail. Guess again. Succeed. (Repeat as needed).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Failure is</strong> an acceptable and <strong>desirable</strong> part of the learning process.</p>
    
    <p>So don't give up just because it's hard.
    You can do it! You're smart.
    Just take guesses, believe in yourself, and give it time.
    You'll get there!</p>
