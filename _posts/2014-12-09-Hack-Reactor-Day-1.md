Yesterday was my first day of [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). What an incredible day.

It's with an awesome group of students, and really impressive instructors & staff.

We all arrived around 8:30am, and some of us stayed as late as 11:30pm. We had a great time throughout -- meeting, learning, working, and joking around.

It was a ton of fun, and now I'm pumped for Day 2.

And some things that came out it:

* Going over our pre-course work, which included the fun [Twittler demo](http://dsernst.com/2014-12-twittler/) I made.
* Brainstorming with other students about a new artists-first [music distribution platform](https://github.com/dsernst/music-publishing-3.0).
* Getting started on [a new super simple way](https://github.com/dsernst/landing-page-1-2-3) to make a landing page to collect interested email addresses for an idea.

All in 1 day! It's hard to believe it could've lived up to the high expectations I had, but it exceeded them.
