## Day 1 of Hack Reactor

Yesterday was my first day of [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). What an incredible day.

It's with an awesome group of students, and really impressive instructors & staff.

We all arrived around 8:30am, and some of us stayed as late as 11:30pm. We had a great time throughout -- meeting, learning, working, and joking around.

It was a ton of fun, and now I'm pumped for Day 2.
