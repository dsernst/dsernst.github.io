## *How Voting Could Work Now, 240 Years Later*

We start from the following principle: <strong>An ideal government represents and is accountable to all its people equally.</strong>

In order to better realize this ideal government, we have set out to make voting more trustable, efficient, and accessible.

We believe modern technology, like digital devices and distributed ledgers, can help us more closely embody the democratic promise of the United States of America.

Democracy requires a fair, easy process that ensures each person’s vote counts equally.

<strong>Here is what is possible right now, with currently available technology:</strong>

#### Trust

Each voter can verify that their vote was properly entered and counted. Everyone can view and validate every vote, and individual voter privacy can still be maintained. Even the software used to run the voting system itself can be inspected.

#### Efficiency

Voting can be an easy and simple process. Votes can be submitted, validated, and tallied in dramatically less time, in just minutes or hours. More votes can be conducted more frequently. Results can be counted and viewed in real-time. We can also reduce the costs and our dependency on physical infrastructure, ballot-workers, logistics, paper, and transportation.

#### Accessibility

Each voter can participate from the convenience of a digital device in their pocket, home, or community center. Many people find the current system archaic, unrelatable, and untrustworthy — why not allow for both in-person and digital voting while transitioning toward fully digital? Voting can be quick, easy, and convenient, rather than disrupting’ voters lives and responsibilities.

### Our Plan

We’re working to create a new, efficient, and effective digital voting system that puts governance directly in people’s hands. We’re hosting a series of events, called DAPs, to use this software.

Our aim is to expand the conversation about how democracy can be better realized, and to foster a community of people interested in these goals. We believe our system can work better for everyone.
