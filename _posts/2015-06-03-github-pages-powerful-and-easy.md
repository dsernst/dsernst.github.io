##### What is it?

A static content host.

##### Why does it rock?

- it's super easy
- it has unlimited bandwidth
- it's free

##### How do you use it?

Make a branch `gh-pages` on GitHub. That's it. You're done.



You can use it to publish projects, super easy. Here are some examples:

- Time Complexity Viewer
- watchout Butters game
- twittler
- David's Jekyll blog. Or Andy Coenen's, Brian Zindler's, or Alan Sun's
- Bloom Filter false positives

Or host static content, like docs:

- React docs

-----------------------------------------------

I gave a Lightning Talk presentation on this subject. Here were the pages I demonstrated in order:

- Github Pages main page: [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)
- You can use it to host a blog: [https://github.com/dsernst/dsernst.github.io/](https://github.com/dsernst/dsernst.github.io/)
- See? [http://dsernst.com/ ](http://dsernst.com/)
- Here's how you set a custom domain: [https://github.com/dsernst/dsernst.github.io/blob/master/CNAME](https://github.com/dsernst/dsernst.github.io/blob/master/CNAME)
- More instructions if you need them for a custom domain: [https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/](https://help.github.com/articles/tips-- for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/)
- Checkout Github's Automatic Page Generator
- You can take projects you're working on from your local computer, e.g. [file:///Users/dsernst/Documents/2014-12-twittler/index.html](file:///Users/dsernst/Documents/2014-12-twittler/index.html)
- Just push the code to Github [https://github.com/dsernst/twittler/](https://github.com/dsernst/twittler/)
- Make a `gh-pages` branch, and now it's deployed [http://dsernst.com/twittler/](http://dsernst.com/twittler/) 404 ---> deployed
- Here's another example, my MVP project: [http://dsernst.com/time-complexity-viewer/](http://dsernst.com/time-complexity-viewer/)
- and the matching code (and its gh-pages branch): [https://github.com/dsernst/time-complexity-viewer/](https://github.- com/dsernst/time-complexity-viewer/)
- Lots and lots of projects use this to host documentation, like React: [https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)
- And Flux, and tons of other things: [https://facebook.github.io/flux/](https://facebook.github.io/flux/)
- Here I put up a game for you (from the Watchout sprint): [https://github.com/dsernst/watchout](https://github.com/dsernst/watchout) -> [dsernst.com/watchout](dsernst.com/watchout)
- And here's an example of using GitHub to host static content for a bash script: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsernst/dotfiles/master/GaiaLovesYou.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.- com/dsernst/dotfiles/master/GaiaLovesYou.sh)
