I found this well worth my time to listen to, and maybe you will too: [http://www.onbeing.org/program/seth-godin-on-the-art-of-noticing-and-then-creating/5000](http://www.onbeing.org/program/seth-godin-on-the-art-of-noticing-and-then-creating/5000)

> We live in a world that is recreating itself one life and one digital connection at a time. On this landscape for which there are no maps, Seth Godin is a singular thought leader and innovator in what he describes as our post-industrial "connection economy." Rather than merely tolerate change, he says, we are all called now to rise to it. We are invited and stretched in whatever we do to be artists â€” to create in ways that matter to other people.
