I read this short and <b>free</b> Kindle book and loved it. It was recommended to me by Seth Godin and now I highly recommend it to you: &lt;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Flinch-Julien-Smith-ebook/dp/B00NLJHGOA">http://www.amazon.com/The-Flinch-ebook/dp/B0062Q7S3S/</a>&gt;<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Flinch-Julien-Smith-ebook/dp/B00NLJHGOA" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/611Nc1aUuUL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA278_PIkin4,BottomRight,-18,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">A book so important we refuse to charge for it.<br /><br />Julien Smith has delivered a surprise, a confrontation, a book that will push you, scare you and possibly stick with you for years to come.<br /><br />The idea is simple: your flinch mechanism can save your life. It shortcircuits the conscious mind and allows you to pull back and avoid danger faster than you can even imagine it’s there.<br /><br />But what if danger is exactly what you need?<br /><br />What if facing the flinch is the one best way to get what you want?<br /><br />Here’s a chance to read the book everyone will be talking about, before they do.<br /><br />What are you afraid of? Here's how to find out.</blockquote>
