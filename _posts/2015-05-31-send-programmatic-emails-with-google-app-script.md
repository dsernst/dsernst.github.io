I recently wrote a script that takes spreadsheet data to email a list of people programmatically, based on their addresses entered in the sheet. It's pretty easy to even send each specific data from the spreadsheet that's only relevant to them.

You can see the basic code here: [http://github.com/dsernst/SpreadsheetAutoEmailer](http://github.com/dsernst/SpreadsheetAutoEmailer)

As an example use-case, I used this to email 30 classmates from Hack Reactor, each with slightly different messages. Many of us haven't spoken since the program ended, so it was really great to already be getting replies.

This was a quick and useful script, and a great learning opportunity. It's handy to know this technique is available in the future.
