I wrote a script that takes a bunch of spreadsheet data and emails a bunch of people programmatically, based on their addresses entered in the sheet. I was even able to send each of them specific data from the spreadsheet that was only relevant to them.

You can see the code here: [http://github.com/dsernst/SpreadsheetAutoEmailer](http://github.com/dsernst/SpreadsheetAutoEmailer)

I used it to send an email to 30 classmates from Hack Reactor. A lot of us haven't spoken in 3 months now, since the program ended. So it was really great to already be getting replies from some of them.

This was a very useful script, and a great learning opportunity. It's super handy to know this technique is available again in the future.
