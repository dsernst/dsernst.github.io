For some time now, I've been making a collection of my favorite quotations. And now I've set up a page to view them one-by-one: [dsernst.com/quotes](http://dsernst.com/quotes)

Refresh that page for a new one.

It was a fun little project to parse the Yaml file, setup Browserify and friends, and configure npm run scripts for easy deployment to gh-pages. Feel free to check out the code here: [https://github.com/dsernst/quotes](https://github.com/dsernst/quotes)
