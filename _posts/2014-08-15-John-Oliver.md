*The Atlantic* has a great piece on John Oliver's new show. Lots of entertaining clips and stories. And then the insightful takeaway is about his editorial freedom thanks to a lack of advertising, compared with other "news" channels (even Stewart):

#### [How John Oliver Beats Apathy](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/08/how-john-oliver-is-procuring-latent-activism/376036/)
##### With a combination of humor and fearlessness, Last Week Tonight has done an unlikely thing: spurred action.

(And related, the Atlantic also just published this: http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/?single_page=true. Both of which are super relevant to [my current project](www.letsfix.net).)
