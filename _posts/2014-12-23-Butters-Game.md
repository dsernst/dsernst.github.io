[Ryan Lee](https://github.com/ryanjlee) and I made this game last week: [http://butters.dsernst.com](http://butters.dsernst.com)

It's inspired by this episode: [http://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s08e01-good-times-with-weapons](http://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s08e01-good-times-with-weapons)

It was written in Javascript, using SVG for the graphics. Believe it or not, it's built on top of D3, which was not designed for game making.

It took us two very full days to make, and was a ton of fun.

Hope you enjoy it.
