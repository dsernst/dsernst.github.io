These are some of the software ideas I've been most excited about recently.

### Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies

- Creating [the Fifth Layer](http://startupboy.com/2014/04/01/the-fifth-protocol/): Entire new ecosystems where currencies can be transfered instantly, transparently & automatically at massive scales.
- Has already had an huge impact on e-commerce, remittances, black markets, charities.
- Lots of exciting new experiments like [NameCoin](https://namecoin.info/), [Gilded](https://www.gilded.club/), [CounterParty](http://counterparty.io/), [Steller](https://www.stellar.org/), [Chronicled](http://www.chronicled.com/).

### Virtual / Augmented reality

- Enormous impact on day-to-day life.
- Technology finally seems to be on the verge of going mainstream: [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com), [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us), [Cardboard](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/) from Facebook, Microsoft, and Google, plus exciting new players like [MagicLeap](http://www.magicleap.com/) and [AltspaceVR](http://altvr.com/).
- Entire new software ecosystem to build out. Following in the footsteps of the transitions from mainframes to PCs to mobile.

### Cooperation apps

- We live in times of new applications, never seen before, that facilitate new relationships of people working together effectively to accomplish their goals.
- Some examples: [Github](https://github.com/), [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/about/), [Asana](https://asana.com/), [Assembly](https://assembly.com/), [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
