On Thursday morning I was clipped by a cab while riding a <a href="http://citibikenyc.com/">Citibike</a> in downtown Manhattan.<br /><br />We were going the same direction in a single lane designated as a bike lane shared with cars. I was on the outside, and the cab came up from behind and tried to pass me while we shared the same lane.   The woman paying for the taxi ride looked at me sympathetically, while the driver was shouting abuses at me.   But there were no serious injuries.<br /><br />The experience left another deep impression of the conflict between motorists and cyclists. It seems to have gotten worse since the introduction of Bloomberg's bike sharing program in the the last few months. A few weeks back, there was an interesting and relevant NYT op-ed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/is-it-ok-to-kill-cyclists.html">Is It O.K. to Kill Cyclists?</a><br /><br />I second the author's conclusions:<br />• too many cyclists recklessly violate traffic laws, such as ignoring red lights, creating a reputation for cyclists as arrogant and negligent to others that share the road. This sucks.<br />• as a cyclists, it often feels as if a lot of motorists are out to kill me.
