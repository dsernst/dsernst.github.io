Here are my notes from last night's After Hours talk at [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com). It was a lot of funâ€” thanks everyone who was able to make it!

---------------------

## After-hours: Software Engineering Power Tools

Node build system in Sublime

  - Keep your REPL step as close as hand as possible!
  - Run code with `Cmd + B`
  - Normal `console.log` and all that
  - Normal `require()` or npm modules etc
  - See install instructions: [http://dsernst.com/2015/02/05/super-fast-testing/](http://dsernst.com/2015/02/05/super-fast-testing/)
  - `>log` expansion into `console.log`

[JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/help.html)

  - Based on *Javascript: The Good Parts*
  - It's like having Douglas Crockford giving you hints to write stronger programs
  - When I first turned it on, I found it was an enormous boost to my understanding of the javascript interpreter
  - Makes your code more consistent
  - [https://jslinterrors.com](https://jslinterrors.com) --> just google any of the errors you get for longer explanations
  - I use the Sublime Package: '[JSLint](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JSLint)'. Similar packages exist for Vim, Atom, etc
  - Very helpful to be there when you press save (vs a copy and paste webapp)
  - JSHint / ESHint are other options if you want more control, but I'd advise starting with JSLint (less config needed) and then moving to one of the others if you find it is too strict
  - You can manually override the warnings if you want:
    - `/*global: foo*/`

[TotalTerminal visor](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/)

  - keeps your terminal always at hand
  - gets in and out of the way whenever you need it
  - remap `CapsLock` to `Ctrl`
  - `Cmd + T & Cmd + W` to open and close tabs, respectively
  - `Cmd + Shift + left / right arrows` to switch tabs
  - `Cmd + Option + up / down arrows` to adjust height

Bash aliases

  - see [bash.dsernst.com](http://bash.dsernst.com) for my aliases
    - getting around:
      - `ds`
      - `de`
      - `dw`
      - `dse`
      - `euler`
    - where i am in git?
      - `gs`
      - `gh`
      - `gd`
      - `gdi`
    - making and modifying commits:
      - `gacm`
      - `gca`
      - `gundo`
    - working with remotes:
      - `cln`

      - `grv`
      - `gpsuo`
