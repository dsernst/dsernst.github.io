It's a subscription service that lets you select up to three ties, cufflinks, pocket squares or other items and have them shipped to you to wear. When you're tired of them, send them back to have the next three on your queue shipped out. <br />When you sign up for an account, you fill your queue—or "My Closet"—with your selections. Each shipment takes 1-3 business days to get to you, after which you can wear them to your heart's content. FreshNeck takes care of shipping—your ties, pocket squares, cufflinks, or other accessories come with a postage paid mailer that you can use to return them when you want something new.<br />FreshNeck is a monthly subscription, ranging from $15/mo to $55/mo, depending on the brands and selection you want to enjoy. Each of the service's three free plans offer different clothing brands, free monthly shipments, and access to clearance clothing sales. For more details, check out <a href="https://freshneck.com/site/page/view/how-it-works/">how it all works</a>. It may not be ideal if you don't often wear a jacket and tie, but if you do, it certainly beats buying a ton of ties and accessories. Even if you don't subscribe, profiles are free, so you can sign up and check out the selection at no cost.<br /><a href="https://freshneck.com/">FreshNeck</a>
