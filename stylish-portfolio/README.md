#### Design Recommendations:
* This can work as a home page or as a one page website.
* The map makes use of an iframe. Use your own embed link, or redesign the map using the Google Maps API.
* This template uses Font Awesome icon fonts. Make sure you include it!
* Use decent quality images for the full page background images, but make sure load times are still reasonable.
* Custom fonts and colors will go a long way with this template, make it your own!
* Adjusting the line height on the paragraph text will help with legibility.
* You can add as many full width sections as you want, be creative!
