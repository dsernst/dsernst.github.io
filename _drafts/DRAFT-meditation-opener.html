<br /><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;">Hi everyone,</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;">If you wrote your name on the Meditation Group list at the Club Fair, you've been added to this informational mailing list, meant as a way for those who are interested in meditation to communicate with each other. If you think you've been added by mistake, or you no longer want to receive these emails, you can always unsubscribe yourself by clicking the link at the footer of these messages. No one will take it personally.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;">I hope you soon discover how wonderful it is that you took the initiative to sign up for this Meditation Sangha. (<i>Sangha</i>&nbsp;is&nbsp;Sanskrit&nbsp;for "group" or "assembly".) The support we can provide each other is tremendously useful. Practiced&nbsp;meditators will tell you how much deeper they can go when they are surrounded by others sitting mindfully too.&nbsp;</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;">For those who have never meditated before, I can tell you from personal experience that trying to develop a meditation practice on your own is incredibly challenging. It can be very frustrating. But with support, you can discover how simple this technique truly is. If you are willing to&nbsp;<b>work with&nbsp;patience and persistence, there will be no question:</b>&nbsp;<b>you are simply bound to succeed</b>. And&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meditationinfo.net/1/benefits.htm" style="color: #1155cc;" target="_blank">the rewards</a>&nbsp;are so very worth it.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;">If you're already excited and ready to get right into things, a few of us will be meeting tomorrow morning -- Saturday, I mean -- in the Meditation Room on the top floor of the Student Union, across from Health Services. A full sitting for experienced meditators will start at 9:30. Then a short guided meditation -- perfect for beginners -- will start at 10. Please enter the room as respectfully as possible if &nbsp;others are already sitting when you arrive.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;">The wonderful Ei Kyaw has offered to lead a nice stretching session after the sitting!</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;">If you're the type that can't wait, here's a tad more information on the journey we will take together:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-daily-quote/20120823.php" style="color: #1155cc;" target="_blank">The distance to the stars is much less</a>.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;">At any time, feel free to invite your friends. Our meditation group will always be 100% inclusive for anyone who is interested. Don't ever feel guilty about not being able to come, or if you want to unsubscribe from the mailing list.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px;">And I'll close with a&nbsp;quotation from a meditation master:</div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="background-color: white; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.727272033691406px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">"<span style="font-family: Georgia, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.454545021057129px; line-height: 20.909090042114258px;">One is everlastingly comparing oneself with another, with what one is, with what one should be, with someone who is more fortunate. This comparison really kills. Comparison is degrading, it perverts one's outlook. And on comparison one is brought up. All our education is based on it and so is our culture. So there is everlasting struggle to be something other than what one is. The understanding of what one is uncovers creativeness, but comparison breeds competitiveness, ruthlessness, ambition, which we think brings about progress. Progress has only led so far to more ruthless wars and misery than the world has ever known. To bring up children without comparison is true education." - &nbsp;<a href="http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-daily-quote/20120906.php" style="color: #1155cc;" target="_blank">J.
