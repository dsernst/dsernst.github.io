Comments on Paul Graham's essay: "What Business Can Learn from Open Source" http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html

Starts out by showing the the market leaders -- Google, Yahoo, Amazon -- *get* open-source, and believe in it enough to run their entire systems on top of.

On the quality of volunteer work: "People just produce whatever they want; the good stuff spreads, and the bad gets ignored." So simple. *Most* of the time it works very well. Of course there are some exceptions, but they can be fixed... would be silly to abandon the entire paradigm.


"That's why the business world was so surprised by one lesson from open source: that people working for love often surpass those working for money. Users don't switch from Explorer to Firefox because they want to hack the source. They switch because it's a better browser."



Funny image:
"Another thing blogs and open source software have in common is that they're often made by people working at home. That may not seem surprising. But it should be. It's the architectural equivalent of a home-made aircraft shooting down an F-18."


"It's hard to see how bad some practice is till you have something to compare it to. And that's one reason open source, and even blogging in some cases, are so important. They show us what real work looks like."



"The third big lesson we can learn from open source and blogging is that ideas can bubble up from the bottom, instead of flowing down from the top. Open source and blogging both work bottom-up: people make what they want, and the best stuff prevails.

Does this sound familiar? It's the principle of a market economy. Ironically, though open source and blogs are done for free, those worlds resemble market economies, while most companies, for all their talk about the value of free markets, are run internally like communist states."


"After Yahoo bought our startup I went to work for them. I was doing exactly the same work, except with bosses. And to my horror I started acting like a child. The situation pushed buttons I'd forgotten I had."
Begrudgingly, I have to admit to similar experiences.


Money quote ftw:
"So am I claiming that no one is going to be an employee anymore-- that everyone should go and start a startup? Of course not. But more people could do it than do it now. At the moment, even the smartest students leave school thinking they have to get a job. Actually what they need to do is make something valuable. A job is one way to do that, but the more ambitious ones will ordinarily be better off taking money from an investor than an employer."
