Financial independence is easier than they make it out to be, if you look at the numbers and ignore the noise of the hoi polloi (and $36b marketing industry)<br /><br />The key is measuring <i>saving as a percentage of earnings</i>. If its 100%, you can retire right now. If it's 0%, you can never retire.<br /><br />The easiest way to move the needle on that is to control your costs. This has the double effect of controlling your ability to save now, as well as greatly reducing the total amount you need to save in order to live the lifestyle you want.<br /><br />Control costs by examining the <i><b>desire</b></i>, not by forcing yourself against things you need.<br /><br />Will buying more things make you happy in the long run?
