Alan Perlis, one of the pioneers of computer science, wrote a well-regarded <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html" target="_blank">list of epigrams</a>. Here are a few that really stood out to me:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">28. Around computers it is difficult to find the correct unit of time to measure progress. Some cathedrals took a century to complete. Can you imagine the grandeur and scope of a program that would take as long?</blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">31. Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.</blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">58. Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.</blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">94. Interfaces keep things tidy, but don't accelerate growth: Functions do.</blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">105. You can't communicate complexity, only an awareness of it.</blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">115. Most people find the concept of programming obvious, but the doing impossible.</blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">119. Programming is an unnatural act.</blockquote>
