"it’s hard to productively interact with people from whom you’re keeping secrets."

what Ellsburg famously told Kissinger!

> In the meantime it will have become very hard for you to learn from anybody who doesn’t have these clearances. Because you’ll be thinking as you listen to them: ‘What would this man be telling me if he knew what I know? Would he be giving me the same advice, or would it totally change his predictions and recommendations?’ And that mental exercise is so torturous that after a while you give it up and just stop listening. I’ve seen this with my superiors, my colleagues….and with myself.

> You will deal with a person who doesn’t have those clearances only from the point of view of what you want him to believe and what impression you want him to go away with, since you’ll have to lie carefully to him about what you know. In effect, you will have to manipulate him. You’ll give up trying to assess what he has to say. **The danger is, you’ll become something like a moron.** You’ll become incapable of learning from most people in the world, no matter how much experience they may have in their particular areas that may be much greater than yours."


Yet another reason not to deceive.
