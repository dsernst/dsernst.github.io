### “What is Right?”, not “Who is Right?”
-- Genius company [ISMs philsophy](http://meta.genius.com/4126920)

> Likewise, when Ilan or Tom (or anyone) stakes out a strong position, and even says “I think we should do x”, what they are REALLY saying is something more like “Here’s an idea for solving such-and-such problem. I think we should either do it, or, if you have a better idea, let’s talk about why it’s better and do it instead of my idea.”

> Don’t worry about “rocking the boat” as you push for what you think is right – capsize the boat if that’s what you need to do to surface a problem.
